# 🎲 Trix's Dice Game

Welcome to **Trix's Dice Game**, a responsive and interactive web-based dice game built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. This project showcases a simple yet fun 2-player dice game where players roll two dice and compete for the higher score.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap 5 for a clean, mobile-friendly UI.
- 🖼️ **Dynamic Dice Images**: Dice roll animations are handled using JavaScript by updating the image `src` on button click.
- 🧮 **Random Number Logic**: Each click of the roll button generates two random numbers (1-6) to simulate real dice.
- 🏆 **Winner Display**: Displays the winner with a flag icon and custom text styling.
- 🎛️ **Custom Styling**:
  - Uses utility classes like `d-flex`, `align-items-center`, `gap`, `justify-content-center`, and more.
  - Integrated custom fonts (like Lato) and colors (e.g., `dark-green-background`, `beige-color`) via Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- 💡 **Accessible Button Interaction**: A large "ROLL DICE" button triggers the game logic.
- 📱 **Optimized for Mobile**: Layout and images scale well on smaller screens using `flex-wrap`, `img-fluid`, and Bootstrap spacing utilities.
